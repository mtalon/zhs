The Zootopia Hit Squad (zhs) is a series of scripts written for a school cybersecurity project in which students roleplay as world leaders attempting to influence, corrupt, and disrupt the activities of other nations. The scripts consolidate mail from accounts on the server, aid the user in analyzing it, and provide an controlled means of distributing a payload to specific users or groups of users.

Version 1 is tailored specifically to the project environment. I intend on cleaning up and keeping this version for shits and giggles. It can still be run on any linux based environment
