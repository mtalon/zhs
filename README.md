The Zootopia Hit Squad (zhs) is a series of scripts written for a school cybersecurity project in which students roll play as world leaders attempting to influence, corrupt, and/or disrupt the other nations. The scripts consolidate mail from accounts on the server, aid the user in analyzing it, and provide an controlled means of distributing a payload to specific users or groups of users.

Version 1 of the zhs was tailored specifically to the project environment. I intend on cleaning up and keeping this version for shits and giggles. They are in the process of being reworked for another project.
